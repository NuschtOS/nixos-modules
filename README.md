# NixOS Modules

Collection of opinionated, integrated and shared NixOS modules.

This includes features like:
- Backend independent LDAP/OAuth2 abstraction with service integration
- A continuation of environment.noXLibs named environment.noGraphicsPackages
- Easy Postgres upgrades between major versions and installation of `pg_stat_statements` extension in all databases
- Easy integration of Matrix Synapse, Element Web and extra oembed providers
- Configure extra dependencies in Nextcloud for the Recognize and Memories Apps and properly setup preview generation
- Restricted nix remote builders which can only execute remote builds
- More opinionated integrations on top of Portunus (Simple LDAP frontend), dex and oauth2-proxy

and many smaller integrations like:

- git-delta
- Harmonia Nginx
- Intel hardware acceleration
- Mailman PostgreSQL
- Nginx TCP fast open
- Nix diff system on activation and dry-activation
- easy configuration of HTTP/HTTPS targets in Prometheus blackbox exporter
- Vaultwarden Nginx and Postgres
- ... and much more!

## Usage

Add or merge the following settings to your `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NuschtOS/nuschtpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    nixos-modules = {
      url = "github:NuschtOS/nixos-modules";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };

  outputs = { nixos-modules, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.HOSTNAME = {
      modules = [
       nixos-modules.nixosModule
    ];
  };
}
```

If your `nixpkgs` input is named differently, update the `follows` to your name accordingly.

By using `nixos-modules.nixosModule`, all available modules are imported.

It is also possible to only import a subset of modules.
Under `nixos-modules.nixosModules.<name>` we expose all modules available in the modules directory.
This requires manually providing `libS` as a module argument.
The following snippet is equal to what adding all modules is doing:
```nix
{
  _module.args.libS = lib.mkOverride 1000 (self.lib { inherit lib config; });
}
```

## Available options

Please use our [options search site](https://search.xn--nschtos-n2a.de/?scope=NixOS%20Modules) to find and browse all available options. It supports searching for option names, wildcards and can be [self hosted](https://github.com/NuschtOS/search), too.

## Compatibility note

Sometimes we use options from yet-to-be-merged Nixpkgs pull requests.
Normally that fails evaluation because lib.mkIf also checks the types if the condition is false.
This can be hacked around by using `lib.optional*` or `if ... then ... else ...` but then the option does not work.
To close that gap we offer a nixpkgs fork named [n√ºschtpkgs](https://github.com/NuschtOS/nuschtpkgs).
It contains the latest stable branch and unstable and it is daily rebased.
We use CI checks to ensure that the modules evaluate on the current stable and unstable branch and some selected forks.

## Design

* Modules should never change the configuration without setting an option
* Unless the global overwrite ``opinionatedDefaults = true`` is set which activates most settings.
  Unless you know what you are doing, you shouldn't really set this option.
